## LJ Day 3

Today was very stressful. I feel like I am already falling behind on my assignments and that really sucks. I was stuck on getting my page to show up dynamically for the past 2 days but I literally figured it out right now (11:45) and I've never felt so good about anything before. Hoping to catch up with everything this weekend.
