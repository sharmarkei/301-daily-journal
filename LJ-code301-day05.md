# LJ Day 5

### Thoughts on week 1

I dont want to say I feel I didn't learn much, because I learned a ton, but I guess I'm just understanding things easier now in 301 compared to 201. I don't feel as lost during the labs cause the code base is already established and I know what exactly I am suppose to be doing. jQuery is lots of fun, WAY easier to work witht the DOM compared to the way we were doing it in vanilla javascript. I besides that, I feeling good so far and I'm real excited about the rest of this class.
