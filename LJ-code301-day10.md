# LJ Day 10

### Weekly Review

Second week of Code Fellows just ended and I'm beginning to feel the pressure. The first week wasn't too bad, and the first 2 days of week 2 were okay. It wasn't till we got into Postgres/SQL that I really began to have a hard time understanding things. Friday we did Functional Program which took me from another loop of confusion. Hoping this week is a lot better than the last. Looking forward to the challenge.
