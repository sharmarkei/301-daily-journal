# LJ Day 6

### We learned postgres yesterday and I found that shit kind of confusing. I usually feel good after I finish a lecture because my code works but for some reason my postgres was being stupid and wouldn't work. I got home and fixed it, that was when I felt like we did some cool shit today.
