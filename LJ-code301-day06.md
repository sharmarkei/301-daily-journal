### Thoughts on Today

We began to learn about AJAX calls, callback functions and all that fun stuff. So far I'm feeling comfortable with everything we've learned and I think I have a good understanding about everything conceptually. Brian was right when he said you'll understand things as you continue and things are going to click. I've been experiencing that a lot lately and it feels great.
