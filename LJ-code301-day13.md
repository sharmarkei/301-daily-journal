# LJ Day 15

Today we did RESTful API. They don't seem too hard but I'm sure it's because we barely scratched the surface. I feel pretty comfortable with what we've been doing and I just need some more practice. I think my debugging skills are getting a lot better. I'm not freaking out whenever I get an error but rather work thru the problem.
